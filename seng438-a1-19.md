# Introduction

For this lab assignment, we had the opportunity to work with two different versions of ATM software. As a group, we had to explore how the software worked and create various tests to find any bugs and requirements that needed to be fulfilled. Before conducting the first lab assignment, the team went in with the limited knowledge provided in lecture content in regards to exploratory and manual functional testing. We were aware that software testing consists of finding any bugs in a system while gaining confidence in the system being tested. In terms of exploratory testing, we knew that this type of testing consisted of human interaction with a system and finding any bugs in the code while exploring the system. This meant that to create any meaningful test cases, it was important to familiarize ourselves with the ATM Machine program we were provided within this lab. In terms of manual functional testing, there was little to no prior knowledge of the topic from any group members. The group went on to learn that this type of testing includes creating tests for the software based on the specific requirements of that software

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The exploratory testing plan for the ATM simulation system will consist of testing most of the functions a little bit, rather than testing a few functions extensively. We believe this is the best approach to testing this system, as it should provide all the required functionality as described in Appendix B. We plan to come up with the test cases by testing the most common paths taken within the system, as this would allow us to cover testing almost all of the functionality of the program with limited time and minimal tests.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing, a method for learning software testing, emphasizes the personal freedom and accountability of each tester whereas manual functional testing requires testers to follow a detailed, step-by-step procedure to assess a certain functionality. Manual functional testing instructs testers to draft test cases in advance and give instructions that specify the expected results. The rules must be followed by testers. It is crystal clear to them what should happen when the test is finished.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

When our group came together to discuss what each pair found we noticed that for the majority of the test, each pair performed was very similar,  however, there were only a few differences around how we tested the session.  One pair tested if the system would ensure that the card and PIN that the customer entered is valid or not, and the other pair tested to see if the ATM would allow a customer to make a transaction and ends the session.  The pair then tested to see if the ATM would allow a customer to make a transaction and end the session assuming that they would not need to test if the ATM would accept a valid card and PIN because it would be silly if the ATM would not.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

We formed pairs randomly.  Within each pair, we divided up the work equally and made sure that each person had a chance to test the ATM and every general function.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We encountered difficulty with deciding to plan out the best method to test the SUT during the exploratory testing phase. Each group member had ideas on how to approach testing the SUT, and we overcame that difficulty by learning to work together and compromising to fit all of our ideas.  We learned how to write effective bug reports.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

During the initial phase of the lab, the instruction file was overwhelming and a bit confusing. After a bit of reading and discussion among the group, the project became more clear. It was a bit confusing learning how to work with Jira, but eventually we were able to get the hang of it. Moving forward, we will go into the labs with the mindset that we will have to explore and learn a bit for ourselves in order to successfully complete the labs.
