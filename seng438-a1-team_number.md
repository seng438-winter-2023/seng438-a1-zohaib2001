# Introduction

Prior to conducting the first lab assignment, the team went in with the limited knowledge provided in lecture content in regards to exploratory and manual functional testing. We were aware that software testing consists of finding any bugs in a system while gaining confidence in the system being tested. In terms of exploratory testing, we knew that this type of testing consisted of human interaction with a system and finding any bugs in the code while exploring the system. This meant that in order to create any meaningful test cases, it was important to familiarize ourselves with the ATM Machine program we were provided with in this lab.
